## INSTALLATION from unmodded
**This is if you don't already have BepInEx installed into the files**

To add it to the game, simply put the 
CONTENTS of the PartyUp folder into:

Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ATLYSS
(or rightclick ATLYSS on Steam > Properties... > Installed Files > Browse...)

These are the files if you're having issues of telling
which files are meant to be in the ATLYSS game folder:

BepInEx (folder)
.doorstop_version
doorstop_config.ini
winhttp.dll

---------------------

## INSTALLATION with BepInEx already installed

To add it to the game, simply take
the PartyUp.dll file found in:

PartyUp > BepInEx > plugins


And then put it into the plugins folder of the existing
BepInEx plugins folder in the ATLYSS files found at:

Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ATLYSS\BepInEx\plugins
(or rightclick ATLYSS on Steam > Properties... > Installed Files > Browse... > BepInEx > plugins)

**NOTE: If no plugins folder is present, create one instead
as BepInEx doesn't come with it's own plugins folder**
(As of BepInEx 5.4.23.2)
