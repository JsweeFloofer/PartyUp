This version of the mod includes
the following mods by Marioalexsan:

ModAwareMultiplayer
NoPlayerCap


ModAwareMultiplayer: Allows Modded Hosting
until Kiseff implements a way for modded Hosting
as it got removed as of ATLYSS version 1.5.0a

NoPlayerCap: Removes the lobby player cap

---------------------

# INSTALLATION from unmodded
(This is if you don't already have BepInEx installed into the files)

To add it to the game, simply put the 
CONTENTS of the PartyUp folder into:

Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ATLYSS
(or rightclick ATLYSS on Steam > Properties... > Installed Files > Browse...)

These are the files if you're having issues of telling
which files are meant to be in the ATLYSS game folder:

BepInEx (folder)
.doorstop_version
doorstop_config.ini
winhttp.dll

NOTE: YOU CAN SEE THE EXAMPLE IMAGE TO SEE HOW IT LOOKS

---------------------

# INSTALLATION with BepInEx already installed

To add it to the game, simply take
the PartyUp.dll file found in:

PartyUp > BepInEx > plugins


And then put it into the plugins folder of the existing
BepInEx plugins folder in the ATLYSS files found at:

Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ATLYSS\BepInEx\plugins
(or rightclick ATLYSS on Steam > Properties... > Installed Files > Browse... > BepInEx > plugins)

NOTE: If no plugins folder is present, create one instead
as BepInEx doesn't come with it's own plugins folder
(As of BepInEx 5.4.23.2)
